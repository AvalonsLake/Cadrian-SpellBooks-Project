      <h2><u>Hello Everyone!</u></h2>
      <p>Welcome to my Library of spells, Open to any and all forms of magic in Kal'Jaru! <br />(collected, cataloged, and presented by yours truly!)</p>
      <p>As of Right now only the Arcane Section is working and has some functionality. 
        The spells that are available are also limited because I have to add them in by hand in my free time. 
        In the future there will be filter settings and a search option for each of the main sections,
        as well as a random spell of the day displayed here in the Lobby! Please enjoy and stay tuned for more!
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p class="signature">Mirth</p>
